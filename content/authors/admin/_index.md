My background is in undergraduate mathematics education, particularly issues of measurement and assessment. I am currently interested in how structural equation modeling and causal inference can be brought into the education research landscape.

I teach a variety of statistics courses in addition to courses like probability, linear algebra, and calculus.

I am a big proponent of free and open source software, specifically R and linux.

My official department website is [here](https://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/mthomas7).
